      "plain_summary": "This bill changes how Utah handles environmental permits for businesses by requiring the state to create new rules for federal air quality limits and expand a streamlined permitting program. It essentially aims to make it easier for certain types of businesses to get environmental permits through a simpler 'permit by rule' process.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects businesses that need air quality permits to operate, as well as the Utah Division of Air Quality that must implement these changes.",
      "argument_for": "This bill reduces bureaucratic red tape and speeds up the permitting process for businesses, which can encourage economic development and job creation in Utah. By expanding the 'permit by rule' program and creating clearer guidance on federal requirements, businesses can navigate environmental compliance more efficiently while still meeting air quality standards.",
      "argument_against": "Streamlining environmental permits could weaken air quality protections and reduce oversight of potentially harmful emissions. Environmental groups worry that making permits easier to obtain might prioritize economic interests over public health and environmental protection, potentially leading to increased pollution in Utah's communities.",
      "key_question": "How will Utah ensure that streamlined permitting processes maintain adequate environmental protections while achieving the goal of regulatory efficiency?",

      "plain_summary": "This bill extends a law that limits how much employers can be held legally responsible when their employees are convicted of crimes. Instead of letting this protection for employers expire, the bill keeps it in place for a longer period.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects employers who hire workers and could potentially face lawsuits if those employees commit crimes, as well as victims who might seek compensation from employers for employee criminal acts.",
      "argument_for": "Employers should not be held financially responsible for criminal acts committed by their employees that they could not reasonably predict or prevent. This protection encourages businesses to hire workers, including those with past issues, without fear of excessive legal liability. It helps maintain a fair balance where employers are only responsible for their own negligence in hiring or supervision, not for independent criminal choices made by employees.",
      "argument_against": "Employers have a responsibility to properly screen, train, and supervise their employees to protect the public from foreseeable harm. Limiting liability too much could reduce employers' incentives to conduct adequate background checks or provide proper oversight. Victims of crimes committed by employees may be left without adequate legal recourse to recover damages when employers have been negligent in their hiring or management practices.",
      "key_question": "What specific circumstances should employers be held liable for employee criminal acts, and does this law strike the right balance between protecting businesses and ensuring victims have legal remedies?",

      "plain_summary": "This bill gives cities and counties new tools to encourage more housing development, especially affordable housing, by allowing them to offer incentives like higher density development. It also requires the state to create a comprehensive housing plan by 2025 to address Utah's housing shortage.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects local governments (cities and counties), housing developers, current homeowners, and people seeking affordable housing in Utah.",
      "argument_for": "Utah faces a severe housing shortage that is pricing out middle-class families and essential workers like teachers and firefighters. This bill provides flexible, market-based tools that allow local communities to voluntarily incentivize more housing construction while maintaining local control over development decisions. The diverse coalition of supporters, from business groups to environmental organizations, shows this is a balanced approach that can increase housing supply without heavy-handed mandates.",
      "argument_against": "Increasing housing density and development incentives could fundamentally change the character of established neighborhoods, potentially lowering property values and straining local infrastructure like roads, schools, and utilities. Local communities may face pressure to approve developments they don't want, and the focus on affordable housing could lead to poorly planned growth that creates more problems than it solves.",
      "key_question": "How will this bill ensure that increased housing development doesn't overwhelm local infrastructure and services, and what safeguards exist to protect existing neighborhoods from unwanted density increases?",

      "plain_summary": "This bill changes the rules about what happens when someone's application for water rights expires or lapses, specifically how much time they have to reinstate their application. It also makes some technical corrections to existing water law procedures.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects farmers, developers, municipalities, and other entities who apply for water rights in Utah, as well as environmental groups concerned about water allocation.",
      "argument_for": "Supporters likely argue this provides necessary flexibility for legitimate water users who may have missed deadlines due to bureaucratic delays, economic hardships, or other valid circumstances beyond their control. The changes could help ensure that viable water projects aren't permanently lost due to technicalities, while still maintaining appropriate oversight through the state engineer's office.",
      "argument_against": "Opponents probably contend that allowing easier reinstatement of lapsed water applications could undermine the 'use it or lose it' principle that prevents water speculation and hoarding. They may worry this creates loopholes that allow developers to tie up water rights indefinitely without putting them to beneficial use, potentially harming both environmental flows and other legitimate water users.",

      "plain_summary": "This bill changes rules about water rights for livestock (cattle, sheep, etc.) that graze on public lands like national forests. It removes some certificate requirements and addresses what happens when federal agencies reduce the number of animals allowed to graze on public land.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects ranchers who graze livestock on public lands, as well as federal land management agencies that oversee grazing permits.",
      "argument_for": "Ranchers need clearer, more secure water rights to maintain viable livestock operations on public lands, which supports rural economies and traditional agricultural practices. The bill likely streamlines bureaucratic processes and protects existing grazing operations from arbitrary reductions in grazing permits, ensuring ranchers can continue providing food production while managing public lands responsibly.",
      "argument_against": "Weakening oversight of livestock water use on public lands could lead to overuse of limited water resources and environmental damage to sensitive ecosystems. Reducing federal agencies' ability to manage grazing levels may compromise their mandate to protect wildlife habitat, water quality, and natural resources for all public land users, not just livestock operators.",

      "plain_summary": "This bill changes how Utah distributes money that's already set aside to reduce class sizes in schools. Instead of spreading the money equally, it would send more funding to school districts that need it most, while requiring those districts to report how they use the money.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects students and teachers in Utah's highest-need school districts, who would receive prioritized funding for smaller class sizes.",
      "argument_for": "Smaller class sizes allow teachers to give more individual attention to each student, leading to better learning outcomes and academic achievement. By directing these funds to the highest-need schools first, the state ensures that students who face the greatest challenges get the additional support they need most, while requiring accountability through reporting helps ensure the money is used effectively.",
      "argument_against": "Changing funding formulas can create uncertainty for school districts that may have been counting on previous funding levels for their planning and staffing decisions. Additional reporting requirements place administrative burdens on school districts, requiring them to spend time and resources on paperwork rather than direct education, and targeting funds only to 'highest need' areas may leave other districts without adequate resources for class size reduction.",
      "key_question": "How will the state define and measure 'highest need' schools, and will this new formula provide sustainable, predictable funding that allows districts to make long-term staffing commitments?",

      "plain_summary": "This bill changes Utah's income tax rates for both individuals and businesses, and creates new tax credits for employers who provide child care and for families with young children (under 5 years old). The bill reduces how much tax people and companies pay while providing incentives for child care support.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects Utah taxpayers (individuals and businesses), employers who provide child care benefits, and families with children under 5 years old.",
      "argument_for": "Tax reductions will put more money back in the pockets of Utah families and businesses, stimulating economic growth and making Utah more competitive for business investment. The child care tax credits will help address Utah's child care shortage by incentivizing employers to offer these benefits, while also providing direct financial relief to families during the expensive early childhood years when child care costs are highest.",
      "argument_against": "Reducing tax revenue will limit the state's ability to adequately fund essential public services, particularly education, which already faces funding challenges in Utah. The benefits of tax cuts and credits may primarily help higher-income families and businesses who can already afford child care, while doing little to address the underlying shortage of affordable child care options for working families who need it most.",

      "plain_summary": "This bill changes Utah's architecture licensing law to reduce the types of activities that would be considered illegal for unlicensed people to perform. It narrows what counts as 'unlawful conduct' when someone without an architecture license does architecture-related work.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects unlicensed individuals who perform architecture-related work, licensed architects, and potentially consumers who hire people for building design services.",
      "argument_for": "This bill promotes economic freedom and reduces unnecessary regulatory barriers that prevent qualified individuals from offering their services. By narrowing what constitutes unlawful conduct, it allows more competition in the marketplace while still maintaining appropriate protections, which can lead to lower costs and more options for consumers seeking architecture services.",
      "argument_against": "Loosening restrictions on architecture licensing could compromise public safety by allowing unqualified individuals to perform complex building design work that requires professional expertise. Licensed architects undergo rigorous training and testing to ensure buildings are safe, structurally sound, and meet code requirements - reducing these protections could put the public at risk.",

      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects homeowners living in neighborhoods with homeowners associations who want to install solar panels on their properties.",
      "argument_for": "This bill strikes a reasonable balance between property rights and community standards. It ensures homeowners can access clean energy and reduce their electricity bills without being blocked by overly restrictive HOAs, while still allowing associations to maintain neighborhood aesthetics and property values through reasonable placement and installation guidelines.",
      "argument_against": "This bill creates confusion by both stopping and authorizing restrictions in the same legislation, potentially leading to legal disputes and inconsistent enforcement. It may undermine the ability of homeowners associations to maintain uniform community standards and could result in poorly planned solar installations that negatively impact neighborhood appearance and property values.",

Schools would also have to look at local sexual assault data to help shape their health education programs.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects Utah students, teachers, and school administrators in public schools that provide health education.",
      "argument_for": "Supporters argue this education is critically needed to protect students and reduce sexual violence. By teaching prevention strategies and legal consequences, students will be better equipped to recognize inappropriate behavior, protect themselves and others, and understand serious legal ramifications of actions like sharing explicit images. Using local data ensures the curriculum addresses real problems in each community.",
      "argument_against": "Opponents likely argue this represents government overreach into sensitive topics that should be addressed by families rather than schools. They may contend that mandating specific curriculum content reduces local control over education and forces schools to cover topics that some parents and communities find inappropriate for the classroom setting, potentially conflicting with family values and beliefs.",

      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects Utah retirees who receive Social Security benefits, particularly those with moderate incomes who currently make too much money to qualify for the existing tax credit.",
      "argument_for": "Retirees on fixed incomes are struggling with inflation and rising costs, and many worked their entire careers paying into Social Security with the expectation of receiving those benefits in retirement. Expanding this tax credit would provide meaningful financial relief to middle-class seniors who aren't wealthy but make slightly too much to qualify for the current credit, helping them keep more of their hard-earned Social Security benefits.",
      "argument_against": "Reducing taxes on Social Security benefits means less revenue for the state, which could require cuts to important public services or higher taxes elsewhere to make up the difference. This tax break primarily benefits older, more affluent residents while potentially shifting the tax burden to younger working families and essential public programs that serve all Utahns.",

It also creates an advisory group to help guide these efforts and requires annual reporting to lawmakers.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects K-12 students, teachers, and educators across Utah, as well as those seeking careers in the energy sector.",
      "argument_for": "Energy literacy is essential for students to understand how power generation, energy efficiency, and emerging technologies affect their daily lives and future career opportunities. Utah has significant energy resources and a growing clean energy sector, so comprehensive energy education can prepare students for well-paying jobs in traditional energy, renewables, and energy technology fields. Educational programs that cover all energy sources objectively will help students make informed decisions as future consumers, voters, and workers.",
      "argument_against": "There are concerns that energy education programs developed by Utah's Office of Energy Development may present a biased perspective that favors traditional fossil fuel industries over renewable energy and climate science. Given Utah's economic ties to oil, gas, and coal, opponents worry the curriculum could downplay environmental impacts or climate change while promoting continued fossil fuel development.

      "argument_against": "Reducing taxes on Social Security benefits primarily benefits middle and upper-middle class retirees rather than those most in need, while reducing state revenue that could fund essential services like education and infrastructure.

Current parking mandates force developers to build expensive parking spaces that drive up housing costs, and many urban areas have more parking than residents actually need in an era of ride-sharing and public transit.",
      "argument_against": "Reducing parking requirements will create serious parking shortages in neighborhoods, forcing residents to compete for limited street parking and creating traffic congestion as people circle looking for spaces. This policy removes local communities' ability to set parking standards that match their specific needs and infrastructure capacity.",

      "plain_summary": "This bill would require Utah to automatically increase how much it pays doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers who treat Medicaid patients each year. Currently, these payment rates can stay the same for years, but this bill would build annual increases into the state budget.",
      "who_affected": "This bill primarily affects Medicaid patients, healthcare providers who treat Medicaid patients, and Utah taxpayers who fund the Medicaid program.",
      "argument_for": "Medicaid traditionally pays healthcare providers much less than private insurance, making many doctors reluctant to accept Medicaid patients and creating access barriers for Utah's most vulnerable citizens. Annual rate increases would help ensure Medicaid patients can find providers willing to treat them and receive quality care, while also helping providers keep up with rising costs of medical equipment, staff wages, and facility expenses.",
      "argument_against": "Mandating automatic annual increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates would significantly increase state spending without allowing lawmakers to evaluate whether such increases are necessary or effective each year. This approach removes budgetary flexibility during economic downturns and forces taxpayers to fund potentially unnecessary increases while other critical state programs might need funding more urgently.",

      "argument_for": "Supporters likely argue this bill prevents frivolous lawsuits and ensures only people with legitimate, direct harm can clog up the court system. By requiring clearer proof of personal injury before allowing lawsuits, it protects businesses and government entities from costly legal challenges by parties who aren't actually affected by the issues they're suing over.",
      "argument_against": "Opponents probably contend this bill makes it too difficult for citizens and advocacy groups to hold powerful interests accountable through the courts.

      "argument_for": "This bill could attract major businesses and data centers to Utah by offering them flexible, competitive electricity arrangements that meet their unique high-volume needs. By creating separate pathways for large users, it prevents these customers from leaving the state for better energy deals elsewhere, which would ultimately benefit Utah's economy and job market. The transparency requirements ensure regular customers are protected from unfair cost-shifting.",
      "argument_against": "This bill essentially creates a two-tiered electricity system that could unfairly subsidize large corporations at the expense of regular homeowners and small businesses.
