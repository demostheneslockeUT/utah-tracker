            <h2>💡 I Caught Myself Being an Idiot</h2>
            
            <p>February 2025. HB267 just passed. The collective bargaining bill. My first reaction was rage. How could they ban unions for teachers and firefighters? I opened Twitter, ready to go off on the bill's sponsors.</p>
            
            <p>Then I stopped.</p>
            
            <p>A thought hit me: <em>"Have you actually read HB267?"</em></p>
            
            <p>No. I hadn't.</p>
            
            <p>I'd seen headlines. Seen the organizations I follow condemning it. Seen my party's talking points. But I never read the actual bill. I was reacting to who supported it, not what it said.</p>
            
            <p>That's when it clicked. I wasn't thinking. I was just... reacting. Tribal nonsense.</p>
            
            <p>And look, if I'm being honest, I do this constantly. You probably do too. Everyone does. The question is whether we want to keep doing it.</p>

            <h2>🪜 Tim Urban's Ladder Thing</h2>
            
            <p>Tim Urban from Wait But Why has this framework that stuck with me. He talks about political thinking like a ladder. Most of us hang out on the bottom rungs even though we're convinced we're near the top.</p>
            
            <p><strong>🙉 The Zealot</strong> sits at the bottom. "My side is right, yours is evil." They never question their own beliefs. Challenge them and they attack you personally. Their motto is basically "agree with me or you're the problem."</p>
            
            <p>You know the type. Calls everyone who disagrees a communist. Or a fascist. Pick your flavor.</p>
            
            <p><strong>⚽ The Sports Fan</strong> is in the middle. Politics is their team sport. They root for their side to win. Don't really care about the actual issues. When you challenge them, they deflect. Whataboutism. Moving goalposts. "My party, right or wrong."</p>
            
            <p>Sports Fans know things are more complicated than Zealots think. But they've picked a team and they're not switching. They might admit their side screws up sometimes. Still vote straight ticket though.</p>
            
            <p><strong>🧠 The Thinker</strong> is up top. They ask what's actually true. What actually works. They question their own beliefs. Genuinely curious about opposing views. When challenged, they listen. Ask questions. Change their mind when the evidence says they should.</p>
            
            <p>Thinkers have principles. But they can be persuaded. They vote on issues, not teams. They can explain the other side's position without making it sound stupid.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>😬 Here's the Uncomfortable Part</h2>
            
            <p>We all think we're Thinkers.</p>
            
            <p>Ask anyone what rung they're on. They'll say the high one. "I'm reasonable! I consider all sides! I'm not tribal like those people."</p>
            
            <p>But here's the real test: when did you last change your mind about something political? Something big?</p>
            
            <p>If your answer is "never" or "not in years," you're probably not as high-rung as you think.</p>
            
            <p>People who actually think change their minds. Not on everything. They have principles. But on specific policies, specific candidates, specific approaches. They follow evidence, not tribe.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>🏔️ What This Looks Like in Utah</h2>
            
            <p>You're using this tracker to follow bills. Good. You're engaged. But how are you engaging?</p>
            
            <p>Low-rung questions sound like this: Which party sponsored it? Do the organizations I follow support it? Will this piss off my political enemies?</p>
            
            <p>High-rung questions sound different: What problem is this trying to solve? What's the best argument for it? What's the best argument against? What would change my mind?</p>
            
            <p>Take school vouchers.</p>
            
            <p>A low-rung liberal says vouchers defund public schools, Republicans hate teachers, end of story.</p>
            
            <p>A low-rung conservative says public schools are indoctrination camps, anyone who opposes vouchers wants kids to fail.</p>
            
            <p>High-rung thinking looks different. Vouchers give low-income families options that rich families already have through private schools or moving to better districts. But they also pull funding from public schools that serve 95% of students. Early data from Milwaukee and Cleveland is mixed. So the question becomes: choice or universal quality? What's the right balance? What does the data show?</p>
            
            <p>See the difference? High-rung thinking doesn't mean you have no opinion. It means you can explain why someone disagrees without calling them evil.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>🎯 One Question That Exposes You</h2>
            
            <p>Want brutal honesty? Ask yourself this:</p>
            
            <p><em>"Why does the other side believe what they believe?"</em></p>
            
            <p>If your answer involves them being stupid, evil, brainwashed, corrupt, or hating some group... you're on the bottom rungs. You're dismissing people, not engaging with their position.</p>
            
            <p>If your answer involves them prioritizing different values, seeing risks differently, having different experiences, or emphasizing different data... you're climbing.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>🪞 Check Yourself</h2>
            
            <p>Think about your last few political arguments. Online or in person.</p>
            
            <p>Did you already know your position before hearing their argument? That's Sports Fan territory.</p>
            
            <p>Did you try to understand their reasoning? Or just look for flaws? Big difference.</p>
            
            <p>Did you consider you might be wrong? Even a little?</p>
            
            <p>Did you change your mind about anything? Even something small?</p>
            
            <p>Could you explain their position in a way they'd agree with?</p>
            
            <p>If you're honest with yourself, the answers are probably uncomfortable.</p>

            <h2>🛠️ Why I Built This</h2>
            
            <p>I built this tracker because I want to climb the ladder. Think instead of react.</p>
            
            <p>That's why there's an "Other Side" button. It's not there to change your mind. It's there to challenge your reflexes.</p>
            
            <p>When you see a bill, you'll see what organizations you follow think. But you'll also see what organizations you don't follow think. Not to convince you they're right. To force you to ask: do I understand why they think that?</p>
            
            <p>If you can't explain why someone holds a different view without calling them stupid or evil, you're not thinking. You're reacting.</p>
            
            <p>And reactions are what's wrecking political discourse. In Utah. Everywhere.</p>
            
            
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>✅ Try This</h2>
            
            <p>Pick an issue you feel strongly about.</p>
            
            <p>Steel-man the opposing view. Explain it so well that someone who believes it would say "yeah, that's exactly why."</p>
            
            <p>List what evidence would change your mind. If nothing could change your mind, you're a Zealot on that issue.</p>
            
            <p>Ask someone who disagrees to explain their reasoning. Then just listen. Don't rebut. Don't defend. Just try to understand.</p>
            
            <p>If you can do those three things, you're climbing.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>👋 Last Thing</h2>
            
            <p>I'm not high-rung as much as I'd like. I catch myself in Sports Fan mode all the time. See a headline, check who sponsored it, already know what I think before reading the bill.</p>
            
            <p>But I'm trying to catch myself more. Trying to ask what would change my mind. Trying to listen without planning my counterargument.</p>
            
            <p>I built this tracker for me as much as anyone else. A tool to slow down. Think instead of react.</p>
            
            <p>So. Which rung are you on?</p>
            
            <p>Not where you want to be. Where you actually are, most of the time, when you're arguing about politics.</p>
            
            <p>Be honest. Then decide if you want to climb.</p>
