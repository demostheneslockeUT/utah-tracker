            <h2>The Moment I Realized I Wasn't Thinking</h2>
            
            <p>Let me tell you about the moment I caught myself being an idiot.</p>
            
            <p>It was February 2025. HB267—the collective bargaining bill—just passed. My immediate reaction? Rage. How could they ban unions for teachers and firefighters? I pulled up Twitter, ready to blast the bill's sponsors.</p>
            
            <p>Then I stopped. A question popped into my head: <em>"Have you actually read HB267?"</em></p>
            
            <p>No. I hadn't.</p>
            
            <p>I'd seen headlines. I'd seen organizations I follow condemning it. I'd seen my party's talking points. But I hadn't read the actual bill. I was reacting to <strong>who supported it</strong>, not <strong>what it said</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>This was the moment I realized: I wasn't thinking. I was tribally reacting.</p>
            
            <p>And if I'm being honest with myself—which is the whole point of this essay—I do this all the time. You probably do too. We all do. The question is: do we want to keep doing it?</p>

            <h2>The Political Ladder: Where Do You Stand?</h2>
            
            <p>Tim Urban, the writer behind <em>Wait But Why</em>, has a framework that changed how I see political arguments. He describes political thinking as a ladder with different rungs. Most of us spend most of our time on the bottom rungs, even though we think we're up high.</p>
            
            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            
            <h3>The Three Levels</h3>
            
            <p><strong>🔥 THE ZEALOT (Bottom Rung)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> "My side is right, your side is evil/stupid/corrupt"</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Doesn't question their own beliefs. Ever.</li>
                <li><strong>When challenged:</strong> Gets angry, attacks the person, dismisses without engaging</li>
                <li><strong>Motto:</strong> "If you don't agree with me, you're the problem"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Think of the person who calls everyone who disagrees a "communist" or a "fascist." They're not thinking—they're waging tribal war.</p>
            
            <p><strong>⚽ THE SPORTS FAN (Middle Rung)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> "My team vs your team"</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Roots for their side to win, doesn't really care about the issues</li>
                <li><strong>When challenged:</strong> Deflects, whataboutism, moves goalposts</li>
                <li><strong>Motto:</strong> "My party, right or wrong"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Sports Fan knows politics is more nuanced than the Zealot thinks, but they've still picked a team and they're sticking with it. They might admit their side makes mistakes, but they'll still vote straight ticket and cheer when "their team" wins.</p>
            
            <p><strong>🧠 THE THINKER (High Rung)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mindset:</strong> "What's actually true? What actually works?"</li>
                <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Questions their own beliefs, genuinely curious about opposing views</li>
                <li><strong>When challenged:</strong> Listens, asks questions, changes mind when evidence warrants</li>
                <li><strong>Motto:</strong> "I could be wrong. Let's find out together."</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The Thinker has principles, but they're willing to be persuaded. They vote based on issues, not teams. They can explain opposing views without strawmanning them. They're uncomfortable with certainty.</p>
            
            <hr class="my-8 border-gray-300">
            
            <h2>The Uncomfortable Truth</h2>
            
            <p>Here's what Tim Urban points out: <strong>we all think we're Thinkers.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Ask anyone what rung they're on, and they'll say High Rung. "I'm reasonable! I consider all sides! I'm not tribal like <em>those people</em>."</p>
            
            <p>But here's the test: <strong>When was the last time you changed your mind about a major political belief?</strong></p>
            
            <p>If your answer is "never" or "not in the last 5 years," you're probably not on the High Rung as much as you think.</p>
            
            <p>High-Rung thinkers change their minds regularly. Not on everything—they have principles—but on specific policies, specific candidates, specific approaches. Because they're following the evidence, not the tribe.</p>

            <h2>How This Shows Up in Utah Politics</h2>
            
            <p>Let's bring this home. You're using this Utah Legislative Tracker to follow bills. That's great! You're engaged. But <strong>how</strong> are you engaging?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Low-Rung Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Which party sponsored this bill?" <em>(checking which team to root for)</em></li>
                <li>"Do the organizations I follow support it?" <em>(tribal loyalty test)</em></li>
                <li>"Will this make my political enemies mad?" <em>(Sports Fan thinking)</em></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>High-Rung Questions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What problem is this bill trying to solve?"</li>
                <li>"What are the strongest arguments FOR this bill?"</li>
                <li>"What are the strongest arguments AGAINST it?"</li>
                <li>"What would change my mind on this issue?"</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Let's take a real example: <strong>School Vouchers</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Low-Rung Liberal:</strong> "School vouchers defund public schools! Republicans just want to destroy public education because they hate teachers!"</p>
            
            <p><strong>Low-Rung Conservative:</strong> "Public schools are indoctrination camps! Anyone who opposes vouchers just wants to protect the failing status quo!"</p>
            
            <p><strong>High-Rung Thinking:</strong> "Vouchers give low-income families options that wealthy families already have through private schools or moving to better districts. But vouchers also divert funding from public schools that serve 95% of students, and early evidence from Milwaukee and Cleveland shows mixed academic results. The question is: do we prioritize choice or universal quality? What's the right balance? What does the data actually show?"</p>
            
            <p>See the difference? High-Rung thinking doesn't mean you don't have an opinion. It means <strong>you can articulate why the other side disagrees without calling them evil or stupid.</strong></p>
